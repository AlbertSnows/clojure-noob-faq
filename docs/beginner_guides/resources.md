# What's this? 

A list of links to other resources to help you learn how to work with clojure

# [Clojure from the ground up](https://aphyr.com/posts/301-clojure-from-the-ground-up-welcome)

The longest and most in depth that I know of that isn't a book. 

# [The Newbieâ€™s Guide to Learning Clojure](https://elangocheran.com/2012/03/26/the-newbies-guide-learning-clojure/)
Small article on clojure. Victim of link rot. :(

# [A Brief Beginner's Guide To Clojure](http://www.unexpected-vortices.com/clojure/brief-beginners-guide/general-overview.html)
Small, quick, helpful overview. 

# [clojure-beginner.md](https://gist.github.com/yogthos/be323be0361c589570a6da4ccc85f58f)
List of links, a lot of which are particularly useful, I believe it's regularly updated (last check late 2021). 

# [Clojure Toolbox](https://www.clojure-toolbox.com/)
List of useful libraries for whatever you're trying to code. 

# [A Clojure Newbie Guide](https://www.clojurenewbieguide.com/)
Has a bunch of additional links. 

# [The Joy of Clojure](https://livebook.manning.com/book/the-joy-of-clojure-second-edition/about-this-book/6)
First book on this list. 

# [Clojure for beginners](https://blog.jakubholy.net/clojure-for-beginners/#_how_to_become_truly_productive_in_clojure)
Another blog series.
